Hi, I am Febin Jose and I am a security enthusiast. I love making scripts and automating stuff for improving security. I specialize in web app and cloud security testing. I also dabble in binary exploitation and source code review.

You can find writeups for various CTFs, online security challenges and other security issues I encounter in this blog.
