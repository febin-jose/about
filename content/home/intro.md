## My First Hack

I still remember the conversation that led to into the field of security. During my undergraduate years, I was chilling with few friends and seniors. One of the seniors told how his friend once hacked into the CCTV system. I was really amazed about how such a thing was accomplished. I started doing research on how it could be done. But each article I read had so many unfamiliar terms that I had to search each term to understand the article. This kept on going as I learned what ports are and how you scan ports etc. And finally after around 2 months of research I finally got access to the login page. Well it took me another month to figure out what default credential were and found one that worked. The moment I saw the camera feed, I jumped and ran out of my room as couldnâ€™t believe what I had done. It was the moment when I decided that I want to learn more and work in the field of security.
