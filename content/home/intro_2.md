These are few statement that I follow throughout my career.

1. Three Strikes And You Automate. I read this somewhere online and it really resonated with how I think. I try to apply this throughout my work. As per the article I read,

   > The first time you do something, just do it by hand.\
   > The second time you do something similar, wince at the repetition and do it anyway.\
   > The third time you do something similar, you automate.
2. Continuous learning.\
   This is vital to grow and improve especially in the field of security. Getting new certifications and learning new material helps in staying updated.
3. Privacy is important.\
   Ditch `google`, use `duckduckgo` instead
